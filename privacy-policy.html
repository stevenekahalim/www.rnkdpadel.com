    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

    <p>RNKD ("we", "our", or "us") operates the RNKD Padel mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our padel ranking and match tracking service.</p>

    <p>We built RNKD to help padel players track their rankings, record match results, and connect with their playing community. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us.</p>

        <li><strong>Email address</strong> — for account recovery and important notifications about your matches</li>
        <li><strong>Phone number</strong> (if you sign in via WhatsApp) — to authenticate your account</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Playing Data</strong></p>
    <p>To provide our ranking service, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Match results</strong> — scores, opponents, dates, and locations of your padel matches</li>
        <li><strong>Ranking information</strong> — your calculated ranking points and position within your communities</li>
        <li><strong>Community memberships</strong> — which groups or clubs you belong to</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Technical Information</strong></p>
    <p>To keep the app running smoothly, we automatically collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device information</strong> — device type, operating system version, and app version</li>
        <li><strong>Error reports</strong> — if the app crashes, we collect diagnostic information to fix bugs (via Sentry)</li>
        <li><strong>Push notification tokens</strong> — to send you match reminders and ranking updates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Calculate and display rankings</strong> — your match results are used to compute your ranking within your communities</li>
        <li><strong>Connect you with other players</strong> — your profile is visible to other members in your communities</li>
        <li><strong>Send notifications</strong> — match confirmations, ranking changes, and community updates</li>
        <li><strong>Improve the app</strong> — error reports help us identify and fix issues</li>
        <li><strong>Provide customer support</strong> — to help you if you have questions or problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>Your information is shared in the following limited circumstances:</p>

        <li><strong>Update your profile</strong> — change your name and photo anytime</li>

    </ul>
